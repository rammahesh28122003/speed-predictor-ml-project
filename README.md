A Speed Predictor ML Project leverages machine learning to predict vehicle speed based on relevant data such as time, distance, and other features. The project involves collecting and preprocessing data, selecting and training models like Linear Regression or Decision Trees, and evaluating their accuracy. Once optimized, the model can be deployed for real-time speed prediction in various applications.
